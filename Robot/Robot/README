This directory contains several versions of code, data, and tools for
Pavlovian-style control (behavior driven by predictions).

1. IntroFromCSP - Two minimal versions of the code.  These produce a
random policy, and a sarsa-driven policy using a wrapper around the
CreateSerialProcessor code.  These pieces of code showcase how the pavlov
code interacts with the robot through csp3.

2. pavlovDemo - Versions of the code that are mature and stable for demos.

3. pavlovBase - The current code with advanced behaviors (Actor/Critic, Modeless, Modes, etc.)

4. pavlov - The original code

4. pavlovGameController - Code modified by high-school interns for
controlling one robot via a RaspberryPi with a gamepad that is
connected by another RaspberryPi.

5. analysis - Python scripts for analzing the data, and for display)

6. Data - raw datafiles, source, etc.

7. vestigial - older code branches

8. InfrastructureTests - code for testing out individual components
(hardware, networks, logging, etc).
