This directory contains versions of the Create Wall Avoidance demos.

1. IntroFromCSP - An introduction to the structure of the agent
interface that has been abstracted from the CSP code.  The two
programs show a random policy and a sarsa-driven policy.  They use a
wrapper around the CreateSerialProcessor code.  This can be helpful
for a user who is familiar with the CSP code.

2. visualAvoidance - This directory has three robot control programs.
In all three the robot learns to predict how soon it will collide (as
measured by a bumper press) if it drives forward.  The robot turns to
avoid a wall if the prediction is high.  The first program is
demowaller2 (with a special modes for turning away and for testing the
prediction).  The second program is demowallerD1 (modeless, stochastic
decisions are made at each timestep based on preferences), and
demowallerDAC (an actor-critic code with a reward that is also a
prediction, but the learning varible rho is artificially constrained
to be either 0 or 1).

3. logfiles - The code will produce logfiles that go in this directory.
