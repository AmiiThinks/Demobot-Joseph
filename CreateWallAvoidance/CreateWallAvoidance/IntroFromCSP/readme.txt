This directory contains starter programs for reinforcement learning
with a Create robot.  These introductory programs are a wrapper around
a slightly modified version of the Create serial processor code.

1. Find and run the create-serial-processor code, available elsewhere.
2. Examine and run the random-policy code.
3. Examine and run the sarsa-remote code.
